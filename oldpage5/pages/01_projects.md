# Projects

This page contains most of my work. I believe keeping an archived storage of projects is important, as I can reflect back and see my growth (or just laugh at how stupid I was).

## Recent Work

- [üçµ Matcha](https://jaysontian.github.io/Matcha/) - Efficient todo list app for MacOS and Windows.
- [üóÇ Memo Cards](https://jaysontian.github.io/Memo-Cards/)  Incomplete flashcard app using spaced repeitition.
- [ü•õ Milk Corp](https://milk-crop.github.io/index.html) - An incremental game exploring the math and logic behind the idle genre. Click cows to create more milk!
